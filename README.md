## Project Description  

The core PlotSense library provides intelligent plot recommendations, automatic plot generation, and natural-language explanations.  
However, it was missing some essential analytical visualization types that are commonly used in exploratory data analysis.

This contribution introduces a **plugin pack** that extends PlotSense with **three powerful visualization capabilities**:  
- ‚úÖ **Heatmap Generator** ‚Äì visualize correlations and feature relationships in a compact, interpretable way.  
- ‚úÖ **Line Plot Generator** ‚Äì analyze trends across time or continuous variables.  
- ‚úÖ **Correlation Analysis Plot** ‚Äì compute and visualize feature correlations automatically.  

The plugins are designed to be registered seamlessly, **without modifying the PlotSense core source code** ‚Äî following a clean, plug-and-play architecture.

## What We Did  

### 1Ô∏è Designed a Plugin Registration System  
We added a single function to handle **automatic plugin registration** from a `/plugins` folder.  
This allows users to drop in any new visualization module and have it integrated instantly into PlotSense‚Äôs plot generation workflow.

### 2Ô∏è Implemented Three New Plot Types  

Each plugin is implemented as a **separate Python file** inside the `plugins/` directory:

- **`heatmap_plugin.py`** ‚Üí Uses seaborn to create feature-correlation heatmaps.  
- **`lineplot_plugin.py`** ‚Üí Generates clean, customizable line plots.  
- **`correlation_plugin.py`** ‚Üí Computes correlations and visualizes key relationships between numerical features.  

This modular design allows new plots to be added simply by dropping a `.py` file with a proper interface into the folder.

### 3Ô∏è Integrated with PlotSense Workflow  

Once registered, these new plots become **first-class citizens** in PlotSense:

- They are accessible through the same `PlotGenerator` interface.  
- They work seamlessly with the existing `recommender` and `explainer` pipeline.  
- Users don‚Äôt need to change their workflow ‚Äî just call `plotgen(...)` and go.

## Why This Matters  

- **Broader Visualization Coverage** ‚Äî Heatmaps and line plots are core EDA tools used in almost every data science workflow.  
- **Developer Extensibility** ‚Äî Encourages a plugin ecosystem for PlotSense, enabling the community to build and share new plot types without touching the core source.  
- **Seamless User Experience** ‚Äî Works exactly like built-in plots, keeping PlotSense‚Äôs API simple and intuitive.
